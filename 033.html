    <p class="standfirst">Chandler's short stories and novels are
      evocatively written, conveying the time, place and ambiance of Los
      Angeles and environs in the 1930s and 1940s.[8] The places are
      real, if pseudonymous: Bay City is Santa Monica, Gray Lake is
      Silver Lake, and Idle Valley a synthesis of wealthy San Fernando

    <p>Wandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile
      I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to
      throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the
      kind of thing which is known as women's magazines. This was in the
      great days of the Black Mask (if I may call them great days) and it
      struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest,
      even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a
      good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small
      amount of money at the same time. I spent five months over an
      18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never
      looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking
      forward.</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Raymond Thornton Chandler (July 23, 1888 – March 26, 1959) was an
      American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of
      forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing
      his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression.
      His first short story, "Blackmailers Don't Shoot", was published in
      1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, The
      Big Sleep, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories,
      Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in
      progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B.
      Parker). All but Playback have been made into motion pictures, some
      more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected
      president of the Mystery Writers of America.</p>
    <h2>Influence</h2>
    <p>Chandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular
      literature. He is considered to be a founder of the hard-boiled
      school of detective fiction, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M.
      Cain and other Black Mask writers. The protagonist of his novels,
      Philip Marlowe, like Hammett's Sam Spade, is considered by some to
      be synonymous with "private detective". Both were played in films
      by Humphrey Bogart, whom many consider to be the quintessential
      Marlowe.</p>
    <h2>Critical Acclaim</h2>
    <p>At least three of Chandler's novels have been regarded as
      masterpieces: Farewell, My Lovely (1940), The Little Sister (1949),
      and The Long Goodbye (1953). The Long Goodbye was praised in an
      anthology of American crime stories as "arguably the first book
      since Hammett's The Glass Key, published more than twenty years
      earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel
      that just happened to possess elements of mystery". Chandler's
      reputation has grown in recent years.</p>

    <h2>Move to LA</h2>
    <p>He moved to Los Angeles in 1913,[11] where he strung tennis
      rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving.
      He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917
      he travelled to Vancouver where in August he enlisted in the
      Canadian Expeditionary Force. He saw combat in the trenches in
      France with the Gordon Highlanders, was twice hospitalized with
      Spanish flu during the pandemic[12] and was undergoing flight
      training in the fledgling Royal Air Force (RAF) when the war
      ended.[8]</p>
    <h2>Return to LA after WWI</h2>
    <p>After the armistice, he returned to Los Angeles by way of Canada,
      and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie ("Cissy") Pascal, a
      married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon
      Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted.[8] Cissy amicably divorced
      her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandler's mother disapproved of
      the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next
      four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the
      death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to
      marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924.[8][13] Having
      begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a
      highly paid vice president of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, but his
      alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and
      threatened suicides[8] contributed to his dismissal a year later.
    </p>
    <h2>During the Great Depression</h2>
    <p>In straitened financial circumstances during the Great Depression,
      Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living,
      teaching himself to write pulp fiction by studying the Perry Mason
      stories of Erle Stanley Gardner. Chandler's first professional
      work, "Blackmailers Don't Shoot", was published in Black Mask
      magazine in 1933. "Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly,
      revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story.
      Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four
      days—and turned out an estimated one thousand."</p>
    <h2>The Big Sleep</h2>
    <p>His first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939, featuring
      the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person. In
      1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher,
      Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later
      wrote for them:</p>
    <h2>Farewell, My Lovely</h2>
    <p>His second Marlowe novel, Farewell, My Lovely (1940), became the
      basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters,
      including the 1944 film Murder My Sweet, which marked the screen
      debut of the Marlowe character, played by Dick Powell (whose
      depiction of Marlowe Chandler reportedly applauded). Literary
      success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself
      as a screenwriter. He and Billy Wilder co-wrote Double Indemnity
      (1944), based on James M. Cain's novel of the same title. The noir
      screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Said Wilder, "I
      would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the
      dialogue, and he (Chandler) would then comprehend and start
      constructing too." Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which
      makes the film so memorable was largely Chandler's.</p>

    <h2>The Blue Dahlia</h2>
    <p>Chandler's only produced original screenplay was The Blue Dahlia
      (1946). He had not written a denouement for the script and,
      according to producer John Houseman, Chandler agreed to complete
      the script <em>only if drunk</em>, which Houseman agreed to. The
      script gained Chandler's second Academy Award nomination for
      screenplay. </p>
