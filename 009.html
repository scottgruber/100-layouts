        <h1>Walt Disney Concert Hall</h1>

        <p>As construction finished in the spring of 2003, the Philharmonic
          postponed its grand opening until the fall
          and used the summer to let the orchestra and Master Chorale adjust to
          the new hall. Performers and critics
          agreed that it was well worth this extra time taken by the time the
          hall opened to the public. During the
          summer rehearsals a few hundred VIPs were invited to sit in including
          donors, board members and journalists.
          Writing about these rehearsals, Los Angeles Times music critic Mark
          Swed wrote the following account: </p>
        <aside>
          <q>When the orchestra finally got to practice in Disney, it was to
            rehearse Ravel's lusciously orchestrated ballet, Daphnis and Chlo√©.
            This time, the hall miraculously came to life. Earlier, the
            orchestra's
            sound, wonderful as it was, had felt confined to the stage. Now a
            new
            sonic dimension had been added, and every square inch of air in
            Disney
            vibrated merrily. Toyota says that he had never experienced such an
            acoustical difference between a first and second rehearsal in any
            of the
            halls he designed in his native Japan. Salonen could hardly believe
            his
            ears. To his amazement, he discovered that there were wrong notes
            in the
            printed parts of the Ravel that sit on the players' stands. The
            orchestra has owned these scores for decades, but in the Chandler
            no
            conductor had ever heard the inner details well enough to notice
            the
            errors.</q>
        </aside>
        <p>The walls and ceiling of the hall are finished with Douglas-fir
          while the floor is finished with oak.
          Columbia
          Showcase & Cabinet Co. Inc., based in Sun Valley, CA, produced all of
          the ceiling panels, wall panels and
          architectural woodwork for the main auditorium and lobbies. The
          Hall's reverberation time is approximately
          2.2 seconds unoccupied and 2.0 seconds occupied.</p>
        <p>The hall met with laudatory approval from nearly all of its
          listeners, including its performers. In an
          interview with PBS, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Music Director of the Los
          Angeles Philharmonic, said, "The sound, of
          course, was my greatest concern, but now I am totally happy, and so
          is the orchestra," and later said,
          "Everyone can now hear what the L.A. Phil is supposed to sound like."
          This remains one of the most
          successful grand openings of a concert hall in American history.</p>
