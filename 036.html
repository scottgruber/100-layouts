          <figcaption>Lupinus, commonly known as lupin or lupine, is a genus
            of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. The genus
            includes over 200 species, with centers of diversity in North and
            South America. Smaller centers occur in North Africa and the
            Mediterranean.</figcaption>

        <p>Consumed throughout the Mediterranean region and the Andean
          mountains, lupins were eaten by the early Egyptian and pre-Incan
          people and were known to Roman agriculturalists for their ability
          to improve the fertility of soils.</p>
        <p>In the late 18th century, lupins were introduced into northern
          Europe as a means of improving soil quality, and by the 1860s, the
          garden yellow lupin was seen across the sandy soils of the Baltic
          coastal plain.</p>
        <p>The first steps to truly transform the lupin into a contemporary,
          domesticated crop were taken in the early 20th century. German
          scientists attempted to cultivate a ‘sweet’ variety of lupin that
          did not have the bitter taste (due to a mixture of alkaloids in the
          seed), making it more suitable for both human and animal
          consumption.</p>
        <p>The successful development of lupin varieties with the necessary
          "sweet gene" paved the way for the greater adoption of lupins
          across Europe and later Australia.</p>
        <p>Further work carried out by the Western Australian Department of
          Agriculture and Food during the 1950s and '60s led to more sweet
          lupin crops produced in Western Australia now than anywhere else in
          the world.</p>

        <h2>Las Virgenes View Trail Reopens</h2>
        <p class="standfirst">It is amazing how life springs back after
          wildfires.</p>
        <p>The Woolsey Fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and burned 96,949
          acres. The fire raced through the chaparral-covered steep canyons
          where it encountered historic movie and TV sets, small ranches, and
          the homes of celebrities.[11] Hundreds of homes in Malibu were
          destroyed or damaged on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway. Many
          of these were on Point Dume that juts out from the narrow coastal
          terrace that lies between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.
          While the firefighters successfully protected Pepperdine University
          to the south, the entire portion of the Malibu coast west to the
          community of Solromar suffered damage from the fire.</p>
