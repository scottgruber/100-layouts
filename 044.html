        <p>Conceived on a grand scale, Union Station became known as the “Last of
            the Great Railway Stations” built in the United States. The structure
            combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style. It was
            placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.</p>
            <p>Los Angeles Union Station opened in May 1939 as the Los Angeles Union
                Passenger Terminal, replacing La Grande Station and Central Station, and
                celebrated its 80th birthday in 2019.</p>
      <p>Approved in a controversial ballot measure in 1926 and built in the
        1930s, it served to consolidate rail services from the Union Pacific,
        Santa Fe, and Southern Pacific Railroads into one terminal station.
        </p>
       
      <p>Today, the station is a major transportation hub for Southern
        California, serving almost 110,000 passengers a day. It is Amtrak’s
        fifth-busiest station, and by far the busiest in the Western United
        States and the tenth-busiest in the entire country. Four of Amtrak’s
        long-distance trains originate and terminate here: the Coast Starlight
        to Seattle, the Southwest Chief and Texas Eagle to Chicago, and the
        Sunset Limited to New Orleans. The state-supported Amtrak California
        Pacific Surfliner regional trains run frequently to San Diego and also
        to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. The station is the hub of the
        Metrolink commuter trains, and several Metro Rail subway and light rail
        lines serve it as well, with more in construction or planning. </p>
        <p>It is the main railway station in Los Angeles,
            California, and the largest railroad passenger terminal in the Western
            United States.</p>
