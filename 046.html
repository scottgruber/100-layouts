      <h2>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power</h2>
      <p>Los Angeles-based artists appear throughout Soul of a Nation, and more
        deeply in three specific galleries, foregrounding the significant role
        of Los Angeles in the art and history of the civil rights movement and
        the
        subsequent activist era, and the critical influence and sustained
        originality of the city’s artists, many of whom have lacked wider
        recognition.</p>

      <p>Featuring the work of more than 60 influential artists and including
        vibrant paintings, powerful sculptures, street photography, murals, and
        more, this landmark exhibition is a rare opportunity to see era-defining
        artworks that changed the face of art in America.</p>
