      <p>In a style he called "minimal realism", Charley Harper captured the
        essence of his subjects with the fewest possible visual elements. When
        asked to describe his unique visual style, Charley responded:</p>
       
      <blockquote>
        <q>When I look at a wildlife or nature subject, I don’t see the
          feathers in the wings, I just count the wings. I see exciting shapes,
          color combinations, patterns, textures, fascinating behavior and
          endless possibilities for making interesting pictures. I regard the
          picture as an ecosystem in which all the elements are interrelated,
          interdependent, perfectly balanced, without trimming or unutilized
          parts; and herein lies the lure of painting; in a world of chaos, the
          picture is one small rectangle in which the artist can create an
          ordered universe.</q>
        <cite>– Charley Harper</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p> He contrasted his nature-oriented artwork with the realism of John
        James Audubon, drawing influence from Cubism, Minimalism, Einsteinian
        physics and countless other developments in Modern art and science. His
        style distilled and simplified complex organisms and natural subjects,
        yet they are often arranged in a complex fashion. On the subject of his
        simplified forms, Harper noted:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <q>I don't think there was much resistance to the way I simplified
          things. I think everybody understood that. Some people liked it and
          others didn't care for it. There's some who want to count all the
          feathers in the wings and then others who never think about counting
          the feathers, like me.</q>
        <cite>– Charley Harper</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The results are bold, colorful, and often whimsical. The designer
          Todd Oldham wrote of Harper, "Charley’s inspired yet accurate color
          sense is undeniable, and when combined with the precision he exacts
          on rendering only the most important details, one is always left with
          a sense of awe."</p>

      <p>Whereas, the brilliantly rich, colorful paintings, prints and
        illustrations made by artist Charley Harper have delighted
        Cincinnatians and art lovers around the world since the 1940s; and</p>

      <p>Whereas, Charley Harper began his illustrious 60-year career as an
        artist when he attended The Art Academy of Cincinnati, where he later
        taught and inspired younger artists; and</p>

      <p>Whereas, his bold, stylized images of natural scenes and his whimsical
        representations of animals have contributed to Charley Harper’s vision
        of "protecting and preserving nature;" and</p>

      <p>Whereas, a new generation of contemporary graphic artists have been
        moved and inspired by Charley Harper’s simplified, beautiful imagery
        and his visionary imagination; and</p>

      <p>Whereas, Charley Harper’s friendship and mentorship of graphic artist
        Todd Oldham have inspired the Contemporary Arts Center to exhibit works
        pairing Cincinnati’s mid-century modernist pioneers and contemporary
        peers in a 15-month exhibition entitled "Graphic Content: Contemporary
        and Modern/Art and Design;" and</p>

      <p>Whereas, Todd Oldham describes Charley Harper’s work as "a marvel,
        brilliant in a way I had never seen before," possessing a "lyrically
        joyous style," "a remarkable and exquisite color sense" and writes that
        "Charley’s inspired yet accurate color sense is undeniable, and when
        combined with the precision he exacts on rendering only the most
        important details, one is always left with a sense of awe,"</p>

      <p>Now, Therefore, I, Mark Mallory, Mayor of the City of Cincinnati do
        hereby proclaim Friday, December 8, 2006 as CHARLEY HARPER DAY in
        Cincinnati.
