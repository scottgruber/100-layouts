      <h1>Santa Monica Mountains</h1>
      <p class="standfirst">Hidden in plain sight from Los Angeles, the Santa
        Monica Mountains offer easy access to surprisingly wild places. </p>
      <p>Even though we’re close to Los Angeles, many locations within the park
        are surprisingly wild and remote. This park is unique in that we jointly
        manage many locations with partners, like California State Parks and the
        Mountains, Recreation and Conservation Authority. It takes a village to
        protect a place like the
        Santa Monica Mountains, and even though we sometimes have different
        rules
        and regulations, we’re all eager to share these special places with the
        public. </p>

      <p>The range extends approximately 40 miles (64 km) east-west from the
        Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County. The
        western mountains, separating the Conejo Valley from Malibu, suddenly
        end
        at Mugu Peak as the rugged, nearly impassible shoreline gives way to
        tidal lagoons and coastal sand dunes of the alluvial Oxnard Plain. The
        mountain range contributed to the isolation of this vast coastal plain
        before regular transportation routes reached western Ventura County. The
        eastern mountains form a barrier between the San Fernando Valley and the
        Los Angeles Basin, separating “the Valley“ on the north and west-central
        Los Angeles on the south. The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to the
        Santa Susana Mountains, which are located directly north of the
        mountains
        across the San Fernando Valley.</p>
      <p>At the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains are Griffith Park and
        lastly Elysian Park. Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the
        Santa
        Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass, over which the 101
        Freeway (also called the Hollywood Freeway) passes from the San Fernando
        Valley into Hollywood. Elysian Park is in the easternmost part of the
        mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east and
        Downtown Los Angeles nearby to the south. </p>

      <p>The range is of moderate height, with no particularly craggy or
        prominent
        peaks outside the Sandstone Peak and Boney Mountains area. While often
        rugged and wild, the range hosts a substantial amount of human activity
        and development. Houses, roads, businesses, and recreational centers are
        dotted throughout the Santa Monica Mountains.</p>

      <p>A number of creeks in the Santa Monica Mountains are part of the Los
        Angeles River watershed. Beginning at the western end of the San
        Fernando
        Valley the river runs to the north of the mountains. After passing
        between
        the range and the Verdugo Mountains it flows south around Elysian Park
        defining the easternmost extent of the mountains. </p>
