    <p>Futura is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and
      released in 1927. It was designed as a contribution on the New
      Frankfurt-project. It is based on geometric shapes, especially the
      circle, similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period. It
      was developed as a typeface by the Bauer Type Foundry, in competition
      with Ludwig & Mayer's seminal Erbar typeface of 1926.</p>
    <p> Futura has an appearance of efficiency and forwardness. Although Renner
      was not associated with the Bauhaus, he shared many of its idioms and
      believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than
      be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach
      of most previous sans-serif designs (now often called grotesques), which
      were based on the models of signpainting, condensed lettering and
      nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms:
      near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of
      near-even weight, which are low in contrast. </p>
    <p>The lowercase has tall ascenders, which rise above the cap line, and
      uses nearly-circular, single-storey forms for the "a" and "g", the former
      previously more common in handwriting than in printed text. The uppercase
      characters present proportions similar to those of classical Roman
      capitals. The original metal type showed extensive adaptation of the
      design to individual sizes, and several divergent digitisations have been
      released by different companies.</p>
    <p>Futura was extensively marketed by Bauer and its American distribution
      arm by brochure as capturing the spirit of modernity, using the German
      slogan "die Schrift unserer Zeit" ("the typeface of our time") and in
      English "the typeface of today and tomorrow". It has remained popular
      since.</p>
