        <q>When the orchestra finally got to practice in Disney, it was to
          rehearse Ravel's lusciously orchestrated ballet, Daphnis and Chlo√©.
          This time, the hall miraculously came to life. Earlier, the
          orchestra's
          sound, wonderful as it was, had felt confined to the stage. Now a new
          sonic dimension had been added, and every square inch of air in
          Disney
          vibrated merrily.</q>

      <p>As construction finished in the spring of 2003, the Philharmonic
        postponed its grand opening until the fall and used the summer to let
        the orchestra and Master Chorale adjust to the new hall. Performers and
        critics agreed that it was well worth this extra time taken by the time
        the hall opened to the public. During the summer rehearsals a few
        hundred VIPs were invited to sit in including donors, board members and
        journalists. Writing about these rehearsals, Los Angeles Times music
        critic Mark Swed wrote the following account.</p>
      <p>The walls and ceiling of the hall are finished with Douglas-fir
        while the floor is finished with oak. Columbia Showcase & Cabinet Co.
        Inc., based in Sun Valley, CA, produced all of the ceiling panels,
        wall panels and architectural woodwork for the main auditorium and
        lobbies. The Hall's reverberation time is approximately 2.2 seconds
        unoccupied and 2.0 seconds occupied.</p>
      <p>Toyota says that he had never experienced such an
        acoustical difference between a first and second rehearsal in any of
        the
        halls he designed in his native Japan. Salonen could hardly believe his
        ears. To his amazement, he discovered that there were wrong notes in
        the
        printed parts of the Ravel that sit on the players' stands. The
        orchestra has owned these scores for decades, but in the Chandler no
        conductor had ever heard the inner details well enough to notice the
        errors.</p>
