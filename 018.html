      <p class="standfirst">Extinction Rebellion is a socio-political movement
        which uses nonviolent resistance to protest against climate breakdown,
        biodiversity loss, and the risk of human extinction and ecological
        collapse.</p>
        <img srcset="img/017/street-art-blue-poster-300w.jpg, img/017/street-art-blue-poster-600w.jpg 1.5x, img/017/street-art-blue-poster-1200w.jpg 2x" src="img/017/street-art-blue-poster-300w.jpg" alt="Blue Poster">
        
      <p>Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent
        civil disobedience to achieve radical change in order to minimise the
        risk of human extinction and ecological collapse.</p>
      <p>On 31st October 2018, we assembled on Parliament Square in London to
        announce a Declaration of Rebellion against the UK Government. We were
        expecting a couple of hundred people. Instead, 1500 came to participate
        in peaceful civil disobedience. The energy was contagious! </p>
      <p>The next few weeks were a whirlwind. Six thousand of us converged on
        London to peacefully block five major bridges across the Thames. We
        planted trees in the middle of Parliament Square, and dug a hole there
        to bury a coffin representing our future. We super-glued ourselves to
        the gates of Buckingham Palace as we read a letter to the Queen. </p>
      <p> Our actions generated huge national and international publicity and,
        as news spread, our ideas connected with tens of thousands of people
        around the world. The XR project was resonating with a deeply felt need
        for community and solidarity. </p>

      <blockquote>
        <q>We are the ones we’ve been waiting for,</q> we chanted!
      </blockquote>
      <p>Dozens of countries now have groups springing up, from the Solomon
        Islands to Australia, from Spain to South Africa, the US to India.</p>

      <p>So what’s next? We are working relentlessly, building our movement in
        preparation for phase two, an international rebellion that will begin on
        15th April 2019. So come and join us. Rebel for life. For the planet.
        For our children’s children’s futures. There is so much work to be done.
      </p>

      <p>At the core of Extinction Rebellion’s philosophy is nonviolent civil
        disobedience. We promote civil disobedience and rebellion because we
        think it is necessary- we are asking people to find their courage and to
        collectively do what is necessary to bring about change.</p>

      <p>We organise in small groups. These groups are connected in a complex
        web that is constantly evolving as we grow and learn. We are working to
        build a movement that is participatory, decentralised, and inclusive.

      <section class="about">
        <p>Human activity is causing irreparable harm to the life on this world.
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09678">A mass
            extinction event, only the sixth in roughly 540 million years, is
            underway</a>. Many current life forms could be annihilated or at
          least committed to extinction by the end of this century.</p>



        <p>The air we breathe, the water we drink, the earth we plant in, the
          food we eat, and the beauty and diversity of nature that nourishes our
          psychological well-being, all are being corrupted and compromised by
          the political and economic systems that promote and support our
          modern, consumer-focussed lifestyles.</p>



        <p>We must act while we still can. What we are seeing now is nothing
          compared to what could come. &nbsp;</p>



        <p>Effects on global human society, if the climate and ecological
          emergency is not addressed, may spiral out of control. </p>



        <ul>
          <li>Sea level rise</li>
          <li>Desertification</li>
          <li>Wildfires</li>
          <li>Water shortage</li>
          <li>Crop failure</li>
          <li>Extreme weather</li>
          <li>Millions displaced </li>
          <li>Disease</li>
          <li>Increased risk of wars and conflicts</li>
        </ul>



        <p>But our leaders are failing in their duty to act on our behalf. Our
          current systems of governance is compromised by a focus on profits and
          economic growth. Politicians can be influenced by lobbies of powerful
          corporations and the media are hampered by vested interest of
          corporate advertisers undermining our democratic values.</p>



        <p>We have run out of the luxury of time to react incrementally..</p>



        <p>We must radically and immediately begin reducing emissions and
          improving carbon absorption, drawing it down and locking it up again.
        </p>



        <p>Only a peaceful planet-wide mobilisation of the scale of World War II
          will give us a chance to avoid the worst case scenarios and restore a
          safe climate</p>



        <p>The task before us is daunting but big changes have happened before.
        </p>



        <p>Let’s make a better world.</p>

        <h1>Food</h1>



        <p>One of the world’s leading medical journals, The Lancet, carried out
          a major review which concluded that climate changed posed “<a
            href="http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1479102/1/Colbourn_final%20commission%20-%20word.pdf">the
            biggest global health threat of the 21st century</a>” because of
          both the direct impacts of extreme weather events and the indirect
          disruption to the social and ecological systems that sustain us.</p>



        <h2>Food insecurity </h2>



        <p>More frequent and severe water extremes, including droughts and
          floods, impact agricultural production, while rising temperatures
          translate into increased water demand in agriculture sectors.</p>



        <p>“We have already observed impacts of climate change on agriculture.
          We have assessed the amount of climate change we can adapt to. There’s
          a lot we can’t adapt to even at 2ºC. At 4ºC the impacts are very high
          and we cannot adapt to them” – <a

            Rachel Warren, University of East Anglia</a></p>



        <p>The number of extreme climate-related disasters, including extreme
          heat, droughts, floods and storms, <a
            href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/">has
            doubled since the early 1990s</a>, with an average of 213 of these
          events occurring every year during the period of 1990–2016. These harm
          agricultural productivity contributing to shortfalls in food
          availability, with knock-on effects causing food price hikes and
          income losses that reduce people’s access to food. </p>

        <h1>Water</h1>



        <h2>Drought and Scarcity</h2>

            almost twice the rate of population </a>increase in the twentieth

        <p>The global water cycle is intensifying due to climate change, with
          wetter regions generally becoming wetter and drier regions becoming
          even drier. <a
            href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261594">A 2018 UN
            report</a> highlights that at present, an estimated 3.6 billion
          people (nearly half the global population) live in areas that are
          potentially water-scarce at least one month per year, and this
          population could increase to some 4.8–5.7 billion by 2050.</p>



        <p>Rising temperatures will melt at least one-third of the

        <p>A severe drought in Cape Town in 2018 led to
          severe water restrictions being put in place. The city came to within
          just days of turning off its water supply – dubbed ‘Day Zero’. Climate
          scientists have now calculated that climate change has already made a
          drought this severity go from a one in 300 year event to being a one
          in a hundred year event. At 2°C of warming a drought of this severity
          will &nbsp;happen roughly <a

            every 33 years.</a></p>






        <h2>Rising Seas</h2>



        <p>Sea level is rising faster in recent decades. Sea level rise is
          caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added
          water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of
          seawater as it warms. Sea level rises will cause inundation of low
          lying land, islands and coastal cities globally.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>As sea level rises higher over the next 15 to 30 years, <a
            href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2014/10/encroaching-tides-full-report.pdf">tidal
            flooding is expected to occur much more often</a>, causing severe
          disruption to coastal communities, and even rendering some areas
          unusable — all within the time frame of a typical home mortgage.</p>



        <p><a
            href="http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/uploads/research/Global-Mapping-Choices-Report.pdf">2°C
            warming &nbsp;would threaten to inundate areas now occupied by 130
            million people </a>while increase to 4°C could lock in enough
          eventual sea level rise to submerge land currently home to 470 to 760
          million people globally. </p>



        <p>The land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland <a
            href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/">have been
            losing mass since 2002</a>. Both ice sheets have seen an
          acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009. Antarctica is <a
            href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1095">losing six times more
            ice &nbsp;mass</a> annually now than 40 years ago.</p>



        <p>In 2014 a team from NASA found that part of the West Antarctic ice
          sheet had already begun what they described as an “<a
            href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/new-study-indicates-loss-of-west-antarctic-glaciers-appears-unstoppable/">unstoppable</a>”
          collapse, locking in at least a meter of sea level rise. If we
          continue warming we will trigger the collapse of more sectors of the
          ice-sheets.</p>



        <p>“Sea level is rising much faster and Arctic sea ice cover shrinking
          more rapidly than we previously expected. Unfortunately, the data now
          show us that we have underestimated the climate crisis in the past.”
