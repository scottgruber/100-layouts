# 100 Layouts

100 LA Layouts is a side project to study layouts and typography. Using photos taken around the city, I plan to illustrate the diversity and beauty of Los Angeles. I like to call this project an ethnographic love story to our city. 

I plan to publish one layout each day for 100 days. I'll practice current CSS layout techniques. And, show the creative potential of art direction on the web.
